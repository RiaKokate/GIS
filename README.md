Project: Disaster Frequency and Impact Mapping
Data: Natural/Technological Disaster Data 
Objective: Map and analyze the frequency and impact of natural disasters in a specific region.
Dataset: EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database) https://www.emdat.be/
Why Dataset: Comprehensive data on natural disasters, including their frequency, type, and impact, which is valuable for understanding disaster patterns and impacts in different regions.This dataset is crucial for identifying patterns in disaster occurrences, such as which regions are most frequently affected and the types of disasters that have the greatest impact. Insights gained from this analysis can inform disaster management strategies, helping to prioritize resources and improve preparedness in high-risk areas. Additionally, visualizing disaster data can highlight vulnerable regions and contribute to more effective mitigation efforts. Through this project, I hope to uncover trends that can guide future research and policy decisions related to disaster management and resilience.
EM-DAT dataset: for its extensive range of disaster data from 1900 to 2024, specifically focusing on the Americas. The dataset includes detailed categories such as disaster type, subtype, location, and impact measures like total deaths, injuries, and damages. This richness allows for a nuanced analysis of disaster frequency, impacts, and responses across different regions and time periods.
By leveraging this dataset, I aim to uncover trends in disaster occurrences, assess the effectiveness of responses, and understand the economic and human impacts of various disasters. Insights gained will include identifying high-risk areas, evaluating the correlation between disaster magnitude and damage costs, and assessing the long-term impacts on affected communities. This comprehensive analysis will provide valuable information for improving disaster preparedness and response strategies in the Americas.
Outcome: Highlight areas most affected by natural disasters and analyze trends over time.
